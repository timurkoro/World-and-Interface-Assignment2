ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First off, I would like to apologize and say that I did not read the rubric properly which is entirely my fault. Since I was working alone I thought I did not need to make a github cuz there is no one to share with.
I read later that it is a requirment to keep progress throughout the assignment. I did start working on the assignment the weekend that it was due, but I did not just do everything in one day. I hope you still mark
my assignment Professor Joss.
PS I used a similar concept to a platform code I made for the Game Publishing Game that weve been working on this entire year. I used the same idea of moving a platform from point A to point B, but added more points,
and made it so that the sprite rotates the right way to give the effect that the Enemy is walking around the platform.
